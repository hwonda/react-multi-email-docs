## Basic example

<BasicExample />

<br/><br/>

## Code

How it can be imported into your project?
The following code is the full code for the basic example. <br/>
```emails```, ```onChange```, ```getLabel``` are an essential ```props``` in implementing **react-multi-email**. <br/>
We'll find out more about ```props``` later.

### Usage (Basic example)

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
// import react-multi-email
import { ReactMultiEmail } from 'react-multi-email';
import 'react-multi-email/dist/style.css';

// styles is not necessary to use
const styles = {
  fontFamily: "sans-serif",
  width: "500px",
  border: "1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238)",
  background: "rgb(243, 243, 243)",
  padding: "25px",
  margin: "20px",
  color: "black",
};

export default function BasicExample () {
  const [emails, setEmails] = React.useState<string[]>([]);
  return (
    <div style={styles}>
      <h3>react-multi-email</h3>

      // react-multi-email component
      <ReactMultiEmail
        placeholder="Input your Email Address"
        emails={emails}
        onChange={(_emails: string[]) => {
          setEmails(_emails);
        }}
        getLabel={(
          email: string,
          index: number,
          removeEmail: (index: number) => void
        ) => {
          return (
            <div data-tag key={index}>
              {email}
              <span data-tag-handle onClick={() => removeEmail(index)}>
                ×
              </span>
            </div>
          );
        }}
      />
      <h4>react-multi-email value</h4>
      <p>{emails.join(", ") || "empty"}</p>
    </div>
  );
