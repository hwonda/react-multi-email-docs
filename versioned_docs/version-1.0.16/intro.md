# Quick Start

:partying_face: Welcome to **React-multi-email**! <br/>This open source will provide a good solution for your project to enter multiple email addresses.



## Getting Started

You can apply **react-multi-email** feature to project in :alarm_clock:3 minutes!

### Requirements

The project consists of the following elements. So your project should also include the following elements.
  - [React](https://react.dev/)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) : version 16 or above are recommended

### Installation

  You can get started immediately with the following command.

  ```bash
  npm install react-multi-email 
  ```
You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

<!-- ## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
